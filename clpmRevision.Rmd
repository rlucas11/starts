  The cross-lagged panel model (CLPM) is a widely used technique for examining reciprocal causal processes using longitudinal data. Critics of the CLPM have noted that it fails to account for certain person-level confounds. Because of this, models that incorporate stable-trait components (such as the random intercept cross-lagged panel model [RI-CLPM] or the bivariate Stable Trait Autoregressive Trait [STARTS] model) have become popular alternatives. Debates about the merits of the CLPM have continued, however, with some researchers arguing that the CLPM is more appropriate than modern alternatives for examining common psychological questions. In this paper, I argue that these defenses of the CLPM fail to acknowledge widely discussed problems with the interpretation of analyses of multilevel data. I discuss some possible sources of confusion regarding between- and within-person effects that these models estimate, and I then show in simulated data that the CLPM is very likely to find spurious cross-lagged effects when they don't exist, while also underestimating them when they do. I argue that there are no situations where the CLPM is preferable to alternatives that incorporate information about stable traits (though there are, of course, research questions for which neither the CLPM nor alternatives that incorporate a stable trait are appropriate).

The cross-lagged panel model (CLPM) is a widely used technique for examining causal processes using longitudinal data. With at least two waves of data, it is possible to estimate the association between a predictor at Time 1 and an outcome at Time 2, controlling for a measure of the outcome at Time 1. With some assumptions, this association can be interpreted as a causal effect of the predictor on the outcome. The simplicity of the model along with its limited data requirements have made the CLPM a popular choice for the analysis of longitudinal data. For instance, @usami_unified_2019 reviewed medical journal articles published between 2009 and 2019 and found 270 papers that used this methodological approach. A broader search of google scholar returned 3,910 papers that use the term "cross-lagged panel model" in the last 40 years.[^search]

[^search]: As of July 20, 2022.

The CLPM improves on simpler cross-sectional analyses by controlling for contemporaneous associations between the predictor and outcome when predicting future scores on the outcome. Presumably, confounding factors should be reflected in this initial association, which would mean that any additional cross-lagged paths between the Time 1 predictor and the Time 2 outcome would reflect a causal effect of the former on the latter (again, with some assumptions).  @hamaker_critique_2015 pointed out, however, that the CLPM does not adequately account for stable-trait-level confounds, and they proposed the random-intercept cross-lagged panel model (RI-CLPM) as an alternative [also see @allison2009fixed; @berry_practical_2017; @zyphur_data_2020]. The RI-CLPM includes stable-trait variance components that reflect variance in the predictor and outcome that is stable across waves. Hamaker et al. showed that failure to account for these random intercepts and the associations between them can lead to incorrect conclusions about cross-lagged paths. As others have noted [e.g., @ludtke_critique_2021; @usami_differences_2020], this critique of the cross-lagged panel model has already been cited frequently and has had an important impact on researchers who use longitudinal data. 

Despite this impact, debates about the relative merits of the CLPM versus the RI-CLPM (and more complex alternatives) continue. Most notably, @orth_testing_2021 argued that sometimes researchers are actually interested in the effects that a classic CLPM tests and that the choice of model should depend on one's theories about the underlying process. Orth et al.'s paper has already been cited over 120 times even though it was only published one year ago at the time of this writing. Many of the citing papers justify their use of the CLPM based on the arguments that Orth et al. put forth. The goal of the current paper is to examine this defense of the CLPM, focusing first on the interpretation of models like the RI-CLPM that include a stable-trait component, followed by simulations that demonstrate the problems with the CLPM and the utility of its alternatives. These simulations show that when the CLPM is used, spurious cross-lagged associations are common and the likelihood of finding such spurious effects can reach 100% in many realistic scenarios. At the same time, the CLPM is also likely to underestimate cross-lagged associations when they do exist. I conclude that there is no situation where the CLPM is preferable to alternatives that model a stable trait and that the CLPM should be abandoned as an approach for examining causal processes in longitudinal data. 

## Ambiguity About Between- and Within-Person Effects

In their critique of the CLPM, @hamaker_critique_2015 described the RI-CLPM as a multilevel model that separates between-person associations from within-person associations. But what *is* a between-person association and how does it differ from a within-person association? These questions are critical, as answers to them form the basis for some debates about the CLPM. 

Certain aspects of the between/within distinction are clear and unambiguous. When data are collected from multiple participants at a single point in time, there can only be between-person variance. All associations that can be observed in these data are necessarily between-person associations. For instance, in cross-sectional data, a negative correlation between self-esteem and depression can only be interpreted as a between-persons association: People who score high on measures of self-esteem tend to score low on measures of depression. If, on the other hand, just a single individual is assessed repeatedly over time, all variance is within-person variance and all associations would be within-person associations. For example, if a single person's self-esteem and depression were tracked over time, a negative correlation would reflect a within-person association: When self-esteem is high in that individual, feelings of depression tend to be low. 

The potential for confusion arises, however, when data are collected from multiple people across multiple occasions. Such data include information both about how people differ from one another (between-person variance) and how each person changes over time (within-person variance). Describing effects and associations as "between" versus "within" becomes more challenging with these multilevel data. For instance, if feelings of depression were assessed multiple times over the course of a school semester and cross-sectional differences in self-esteem from the start of the semester predicted changes in depression over that period, would this interaction reflect a between-person association or one that is within-person? Although I believe that most methodologists would label this a between-person association (because individual differences in self-esteem are predicting individual differences in depression slopes), within-person data (each person's change over the course of the study) are used to estimate this between-person association. The example shows that the decision to label an association as "between" or "within" is not always linked in a straightforward way to the type of data that contributes to the effect. 

This is important because @orth_testing_2021 rely heavily on the *description* of the cross-lagged paths in the RI-CLPM as a *within-person effect* in their defense of the CLPM. They state that "a potential disadvantage of the proposed alternatives to the CLPM is that they estimate within-person prospective effects only, but not between-person prospective effects" (p. 1014) and that "in many fields researchers are also interested in gaining information about the consequences of between-person differences" (p. 1014). They go on to argue that "a limitation of the RI-CLPM is that it does not provide any information about the consequences of between-person differences. In the RI-CLPM, the between-person differences are relegated to the random intercept factors" (p. 1026). Later on the same page, they state that "The RI-CLPM includes [an] unrealistic assumption, specifically that the between-person variance is perfectly stable" (p. 1026). @orth_testing_2021 do acknowledge later on the same page that "some portion of the systematic between-person variance will be included in the residualized factors" (p. 1026). However, they argue that this discrepancy is a conceptual problem for the RI-CLPM: They state that "the cross-lagged effects in the RI-CLPM are not pure within-person effects but partially confounded with between-person variance" (p. 1026). 

These statements reflect an apparent misunderstanding of the RI-CLPM and related models. Confusion about these issues likely results from the previously mentioned ambiguities regarding the terms "between-person" and "within-person" along with fundamental differences in the ways that different types of multilevel models separate between- and within-person effects. The RI-CLPM separates between-person associations from within-person associations, but it does not do so by "relegating all between-person differences to the random intercept." Because Orth et al.'s [-@orth_testing_2021] defense of the CLPM rests on a flawed interpretation of the alternatives, their defense against these alternatives is not valid. 

As @curran_disaggregation_2011 noted, what is probably the most familiar way to separate between-person effects from within-person effects is the use of person-mean centering. For instance, in the context of multilevel modeling, researchers are often warned that if they are not careful about how they enter variables into the model, what may look like within-person effects (e.g., the "Level-1" effects in repeated-measures data) can actually reflect a mix of between- and within-person associations. The recommended solution in this context is to person-center the predictor [e.g., @curran_disaggregation_2011; @enders2007centering], where each observation now reflects a deviation from a person's mean. When centering this way, the Level-1 part of the model tests whether occasion-specific deviations from a person's mean predict variability in the outcome. 

In their own critique of the RI-CLPM, @ludtke_critique_2021 imply that the RI-CLPM and related models accomplish the separation of between- and within-person associations in the exact same way as the multilevel modeling approach described by @curran_disaggregation_2011. They cautioned that "researchers should be aware that within-person effects are based on person-mean centered (i.e., ipsatized) scores that only capture temporary fluctuations around individual person means" which would be "less appropriate for understanding the potential effects of causes that explain differences between persons" (p. 18). They do not clarify, however, that the "person mean" in their description is not the observed person mean calculated from the actual observations (as it would typically be in the traditional multilevel modeling context), but a latent mean that reflects only the variance that is perfectly stable over time. These "means" are---conceptually and empirically---very different things. 

To appreciate this difference, consider the example in Figure \@ref(fig:between). The models shown in this figure represent a single variable, *X*, measured across three occasions. Panel A shows the data-generating process that I used for this example, which reflects a very simple autoregressive model. In this example, the initial variance for *X1* was set to 1, and the wave-to-wave stability was set to .5. This simple autoregressive model tests how strongly between-person differences at Time 1 predict between-person differences at Time 2. Note that it would be possible to extend this model to a traditional CLPM by adding an outcome variable at each wave and then testing the cross-lagged paths between the predictor and outcome. 

With these data, it is possible (and meaningful) to consider what each person's mean would be across these three occasions. A simple latent-trait model (like the one shown in Panel B) would capture the variance in these means. Note that in this simple latent-trait model, the variance in each wave is partitioned into variance in the person mean (the variance of the common latent trait, which is .48 in this example) and variance in the wave-specific deviations from that mean (.68, .42, and .64). The components of the model in the blue box could be considered the "within-person" part of this model, as these residuals reflect wave-specific deviations from the person mean. The partitioning of variance in this example is quite similar to the descriptions that @ludtke_critique_2021 and @orth_testing_2021 provide for the variance partitioning in the RI-CLPM.

It is the third panel of this figure, however, that most closely represents (in a univariate setting) what the RI-CLPM and related models actually do. In this panel, the residuals have an autoregressive structure, where the residuals for each wave are predicted from the residuals of the wave prior (exactly as they are in the RI-CLPM). When residuals are structured in this way, they capture between-person variance that is somewhat---but usually not perfectly---stable over time. By structuring the residuals to allow for some wave-to-wave stability, the latent trait now includes only the variance that is *perfectly* stable over this time period. The residuals no longer represent deviations from the person mean, they represent deviations from a *perfectly stable trait*[^kou]. Importantly, all though the parts of the model included in the blue box still represent the "within-person" model, these structured residuals now link meaningful between-person differences at Time 1 to between-person differences at Time 2. Indeed, in this specific example, because the data-generating process specifies that there is no perfectly stable variance, these "deviations" are identical to the original variables themselves. The parameter estimates from this model almost perfectly recover the values specified in the simple autoregressive data-generating process[^converge].

[^kou]: Thanks to Kou Murayama for discussions that clarified this issue. 
[^converge]: Note that this model fit to data with no stable trait variance will often result in inadmissable solutions because with true latent-trait variance of 0, it is possible to get estimates that are negative. 

A comparison of the variance estimates across Panels B and C show that the latent trait that links the three observations captures something very different in a simple latent-trait model as compared to a model with structured residuals. However, one could describe either the latent trait from Panel B or the one from Panel C as reflecting the "between-person variance" in these assessments. The latent trait in Panel B captures between-person differences in mean levels of *X* during the observed period of assessment; the latent trait in Panel C captures between-person differences in *a hypothetically perfectly stable* trait. Moreover, one could describe the residuals in either model as reflecting the "within-person" part of the model even though they correspond to conceptually different things. The occasion-specific residuals in Panel C do not reflect deviations from the person mean, they reflect deviations from the perfectly stable trait. 

In short, Orth et al. criticize the RI-CLPM for assuming that all between-person differences are perfectly stable over time and for removing all between-person variance from the within-person associations, but those critiques are not correct. In the RI-CLPM and other related models, between-person variance is simply *defined* as the variance that is perfectly stable over time. Moreover, between-person variance (broadly defined as differences between individuals) is clearly included in the "within-person" part of the model, as Panel C of \@ref(fig:between) shows. Indeed, for variables for which there is no stable-trait variance, the estimates for the cross-lagged paths from the RI-CLPM will be identical to those from the CLPM because the RI-CLPM reduces to the CLPM in such cases. Thus, the first problem with the arguments presented by @orth_testing_2021 is that their primary critique of the RI-CLPM (and corresponding defense of the CLPM) rests on an incorrect intepretation of that model and its relation to the CLPM. 

## Beyond Between and Within

In the previous section, I focused on the ambiguity in the definition of between and within-person effects, discussing how these ambiguities might lead to misinterpretations of models like the RI-CLPM. In the next section, I first review and expand on previous explanations for why separating these levels of analysis is critical when examining lagged effects. I then propose an alternative way of thinking about the problems with the CLPM that does not rely on the distinction between between- and within-person associations.  

As noted previously, data that have been collected from multiple people across multiple occasions include information both about how people differ from one another (between-person variance) and how each person changes over time (within-person variance). Methodologists have, for many decades, warned that failure to consider multilevel structures can lead to incorrect conclusions [see @curran_disaggregation_2011, for a review and discussion]. It would be wrong, for instance, to draw conclusions about within-person effects from between-person data or to draw conclusions about between-person differences from within-person data because the association can be completely different at these different levels. In addition---and most importantly for debates about the merits of the CLPM---when data do have a multilevel structure, but this multilevel structure is not taken into account through appropriate analytic methods, the estimates obtained from analyses of these data reflect an uninterpretable mix of between and within-person effects [@raudenbush_hierarchical_2002]. @hamaker_critique_2015 emphasized that a strength of the RI-CLPM is its ability to separate between-person effects from within-person effects when examining reciprocal associations. 

The traditional CLPM is a classic example of an analysis that fails to separate between-person associations from within. It is important to note, however, it is especially important to consider levels of analysis in the context of lagged effects precisely because the goal of these analyses is to elucidate causal effects. 





critical in the context of CLPM when examining causal effects. Bring back quote about examining the consequences of between-person differences. 

@orth_testing_2021 defend the CLPM by providing a very literal description of what the model estimates. For instance, they state that when examining the reciprocal effects of self-esteem on depression in a traditional CLPM, significant cross-lagged paths from self-esteem to depression can be interpreted to mean that "When individuals have low self-esteem (relative to others), they will experience a subsequent rank-order increase in depression compared to individuals with high self-esteem." While technically correct, this "rank-order change" may have nothing to do with the "between-person prospective effect" that @orth_testing_2021 hope to assess. Indeed, significant cross-lagged paths in the CLPM can result from purely between-person associations, purely within-person effects, or some combination of the two (even combinations where the within and between-person associations are in the opposite direction). Rather than clarifying how the CLPM solves the uncontroversial interpretational issues that are inevitably involved with this type of analysis, @orth_testing_2021 sidestep this perennial analytic issue. If these authors believe that the CLPM somehow avoids the interpretational challenges inherent in all analyses of multilevel data, then they must do more than simply assert this to be true. Estimates from the CLPM are uninterpretable for all the same reasons that any analysis of multilevel data that fails to account for the multilevel structure are.

As a simple demonstration, I generated two waves of data for two variables *X* and *Y* for 10,000 people. Panel A of Figure \@ref(fig:spurious) shows the data-generating process, which is a very simple correlated-latent-trait model. I set the variance of *X* and *Y* to be 1, and the reliability of the indicators to be .5. *X* and *Y* are only associated at the between-person level ($r = .7$). Panel B shows what happens if we fit the CLPM to the generated data. As can be seen in this panel, there would be strong evidence for reciprocal associations between the two, even though there are no over-time associations whatsoever. In other words, this analysis shows evidence for what @orth_testing_2021 call a "between-person prospective effect," when the underlying association is only at the between-persons level; there is nothing prospective about it. The CLPM simply cannot distinguish between associations that occur at the stable-trait level from those that incorporate some change over time. 

```{r spurious, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap='Spurious cross-lagged effects in data with only between-person associations. Panel A is the data-generating model; Panel B shows estimates from the CLPM fit to the generated data. Coefficients are unstandardized estimates. Residuals are not shown but are estimated.'}

Why it's important to separate. 

It can sometimes be difficult to think about how the complex nature of multilevel data can affect conclusions about underlying processes. Indeed, I worry that framing the discussion of the CLPM solely as an issue of multilevel structure has led to more confusion than clarity (even though thinking about it in these terms has led to the development of practical solutions to the underlying problem in the form of the RI-CLPM). Figure \@ref(fig:spurious) helps, however, by providing an alternative way of thinking about the problems with the CLPM and the benefits of alternative models that incorporate a stable-trait component. Models like the RI-CLPM and STARTS are useful because they test an extremely plausible alternative explanation of the underlying pattern of correlations that is being modeled when the CLPM is used, an alternative explanation that has nothing to do with temporal effects. 

The logic of the CLPM is very similar to the logic of any other regression model where we assess whether one variable predicts another after controlling for relevant confounds. When we test whether Time 1 *X* predicts Time 2 *Y* after controlling for Time 1 *Y*, we hope to capture whether there is something unique about *X*---something that cannot be explained by the concurrent association between *X* and *Y*---that helps us predict *Y* at a later time. But as @westfall_statistically_2016 pointed out when discussing the difficulty of establishing incremental predictive validity of any kind, if the measure that we include as a control (i.e., Time 1 *Y*) is not a perfect measure of what we're trying to account for, then it is possible---indeed, quite easy---to find spurious "incremental validity" effects. Referring to Figure \@ref(fig:spurious), *Y~1~* is an imperfect measure of the latent variable *Y*. Thus, controlling for *Y~1~* does not control for all of the association between *X* and *Y*, which means that *X~1~* will still have incremental predictive validity of *Y~2~* even after controlling for *Y~1~*. Technically, @orth_testing_2021 are correct that the cross-lagged effect in Panel B means those who score high on *X~1~* would report a "rank-order increase" on *Y* over time, but this rank-order increase results from imperfect control of *Y*, not true change over time.

One might argue that concerns about inadequate control in the CLPM become moot as long as researchers avoid talking about causal effects. For instance, one might be tempted to interpret the cross-lagged path from *X~1~* to *Y~2~* purely descriptively: This path might represent the extent to which current levels of *X* predict (residualized) change in *Y*. However, even this more limited interpretation of this path is not warranted when stable-trait variance exists. Again, Figure \@ref(fig:spurious) shows that regardless of the interpretation, the path from *X~1~* to *Y~2~* can emerge simply due to unmodeled stable-trait associations. 

In summary, decades of methodological work show the importance of distinguishing between-person associations from within-person effects when data have a multilevel structure. Failing to do so results in uninterpretable estimates of the association between predictors and outcomes. The CLPM is not an exception to this widely discussed rule. In defending the CLPM, @orth_testing_2021 sidestep the issue of how a model that fails to distinguish between levels can lead to interpretable results; instead, they simply assert that the effects from the CLPM are meaningful. It is easy to show, however, that when the CLPM is used, it is possible to mistake purely between-person associations for over-time effects, which confirms the long-standing methodological warning about the failure to separate effects at different levels. Moreover, researchers do not even need to think about these issues in terms of multilevel models to appreciate the problems with the CLPM. The CLPM simply cannot rule out an extremely plausible alternative explanation for the underlying pattern of correlations that lead to evidence of temporal associations when only the CLPM is used. I now turn to a set of simulations that demonstrate just how bad this problem likely is.
